#TODO: Add light effects during attack - feature todo: repeating light effects, possibly in sync with attack wave
# (entertainment API would be perfect for this, but prob no time for that?)
# Maybe a possible solution is to be able to trigger other scripts and have a lighting script that can be repeated.

#john says "No response, he must be under a spell! We should try to scare him away."
#mary says "I do remember he was afraid of rattle snakes."
#TODO: Person must find something that can make the sound of a rattle snake - like a wooden rattle!!

# TODO: add a trigger to let john and mary give more hints after a certain amount of time.

#wait 5 seconds
#mary says "How can we make a rattle snake sound?"
#john says "Maybe there is something lying around here to make such a sound"
